# Email_Spam_Notification
These days, emails are a huge part of our personal and work life. But along with important 
messages, we also get a lot of spam, junk emails that can be annoying, risky, or even 
dangerous (like phishing scams).
To deal with this, we can use Machine Learning (ML) to automatically filter out spam emails. 
In this project, we’re building a spam email classifier using the Spam Assassin dataset. I used 
the Naïve Bayes algorithm along with TF-IDF vectorization to process and classify emails. 
The goal is to create a system that can accurately tell the difference between spam and ham
emails.
